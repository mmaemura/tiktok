### Abstract
Over the past few years, the social media app “TikTok” has gained substantial popularity, and it currently boasts an impressive 1 billion users per month. In popular culture, TikTok is regarded as an addictive app and many users report spending hours scrolling through videos on TikTok. Since social media addiction is associated with anxiety and depression, we hope to closely examine the content posted on the app and the effect that it may have on users. To do so, we will collect text data from each TikTok including captions, hashtags, and sounds in order to identify the sentiments associated with trending TikTok’s.

### Planned deliverables
For full success, we plan to present our work in a Jupyter notebook that we will push to the web as a blog post on our websites. The blog will discuss our data collection process and analysis on the data, incorporating interactive charts. For partial success, we can still present the data we collected, and the quantity and quality of our charts may be lower. 

### Resources Required
We will use an Unofficial TikTok API linked here. From there, we will create a data set of the top 50 trending TikToks each day collected over a one week period. While the API can collect the TikToks’ creators, captions, hashtags, and sounds, since we are interested in analyzing the content through sentiment analysis, we will require a process to transcribe the audio from the sounds. 

### Tools and Skills Required
First, to collect data, the API must be installed, and then we will be able to use our Python skills to navigate the dictionaries to collect the data. Next, we will need to learn to build a data set from which we will further develop our understanding of sentiment analysis. Our analysis will consist of visualizations and will be presented as a blog post, using thorough and professional chart-making skills.
